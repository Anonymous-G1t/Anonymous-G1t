# mygit-inbox 

A mailing list archive / mbox viwer based on [public-inbox](https://public-inbox.org/README.html)

The advantage of the public-inbox model is that it is pull-only. There are a number of advantages to this, but the primary one for this project is that it makes setting up a mailing list archive very easy -- just get a consumer email account and set up an IMAP connection

This can also be run separately as an email archive, unrelated to git patches!
